Horizon Zero Dawn
8/10
I always struggle getting through single players game but something about this game kept making me want to finish it. It took me years but I DID IT. The story is compelling and the gameplay is complex enough to keep you on your toes. Now let's see how many years it takes me to get through the sequel.
