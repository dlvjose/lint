Clair Obscur: Expedition 33
9/10
Man oh man. This game is freaking amazing. Literally the only gripe I have is the menus. Navigating through them feels like a chore even though the rest of the experience is more than enjoyable. I hope they continue this IP. They have something incredible going. Hate to see so many people shy away from playing this game because of the turn based mechanics, even though it innovates on that aspect at every turn during battles.
