Monster Hunter Wilds
5/10
I can see the appeal but this game is not for me. It requires to much mental space to keep up even on a basic level. While I played the beta and maybe it wasn't the most polished experience I felt like I was missing some basic mechanics. Felt like the game was intentionally hiding them from me even though the beta was 50% mechanics/tutorials. Maybe next time.
