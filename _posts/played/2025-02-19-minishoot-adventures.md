Minishoot' Adventures
8/10
Bought this game on a whim after watching a YouTube video and it is so freaking fun. Didn't expect to enjoy it this much. Didn't expect the depth it has but it is more than welcome. I'm not usually drawn to bullet hell games but after this surprise I might have to try out some more of them.
