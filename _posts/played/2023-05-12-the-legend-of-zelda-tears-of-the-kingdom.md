The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom
9/10
It's hard not to compare this game to BOTW but it definitely feels like a more polished version of it. Things like the memories felt more intentional and the story felt more connected to the rest of the world. In a matter of a month I doubled the hours I had on BOTW.
