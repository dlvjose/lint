Pokémon Legends: Arceus
8/10
This game would be my favorite Pokémon game if nostalgia wasn't a factor and there wasn't so much dialogue. Even with the text speed on fast. The new mechanics are a much needed update to the franchise and I hope to see them evolve them in the upcoming generations. Open world gen 9 was confirmed!!
