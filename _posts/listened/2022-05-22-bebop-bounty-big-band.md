Bebop Bounty Big Band
9/10
Played around with the idea of going to this a lot in my head because of how long and stressful of a weekend we had. But it was all worth it in the end. Super fun concept, would love to see it again in a bigger venue. All the props to all the musicians, they were all incredible.
