Transformers: Beast Wars
7/10
This series has been incredibly refreshing. It's to see an old "franchise" through a new lens. Some characters are very forgettable but that's okay. It seems like the pacing is giving everyone their time to shine. Seeing a new roster surrounded by familiar faces is very nice and the writing doesn't feel forced. It's bringing me back to the "More than Meets the Eye" days.
