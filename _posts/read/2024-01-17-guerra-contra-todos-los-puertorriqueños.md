Guerra Contra Todos los Puertorriqueños: Revolución y Terror en la Colonia Americana
8/10
Learned a lot from this book. It's sad to see what the people of Puerto Rico have endured. As a second generation Puerto Rican, with family that fled from political nightmares in Cuba and the Dominican Republic I was raised to think Puerto Rico was a blessing/haven. The book is a bit repetitive but it seems to do it to drill down the point.
