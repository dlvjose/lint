The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue
5/10
The beginning was interesting but then it started to drag. The second fourth of the book felt a bit useless, maybe purposeless. While I enjoyed Henry's character felt slim, outside of serving as a plot device, as Addie's crutch. Luc was by far the most interesting character and I would've loved to see him explored more but the book isn't named after him after all. Would've loved to see more of the interactions between Luc and Addie. The payoff at the ending felt a little underweight but completely reasonable.
