Dollars and Sense
6/10
I can see this book being more beneficial for someone starting their financial journey. In my case it felt like it repeated ideas that I've seen a million times. That being said, I see the benefit of condensing all these ideas into a book. For me, I could've gotten what I need from the book by just reading the last few chapters.
