User friendly: How the hidden rules of design are changing the way we live, work, and play
8/10
Took me to long to read this book but bless the library. Why didn't I get a library card sooner. Even having the schedule helps me. This book is partly responsible for helping me stay in love with my profession while navigating the sea of bullshit and bureocracy that we all experience at our jobs. This clearly highlights the type of impact design can have when taking seriously and pursued with intention.
