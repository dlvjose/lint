Read Write Own: Building the Next Era of the Internet
7/10
Read write own while informative feels very biased. No information about the negatives or effects of blockchain/crypto tech is mentioned in this book. While I understand that most technology that was been widely adopted has a net negative effect on the world I hoped to see an opposite perspective for blockchain since people praise it for being “pro-people/pro-individual”. I’m more than down to make economics more digestible and accessible for individuals but at what cost.
