F*ck It, I'll Start Tomorrow: A True Story
8/10
The first chapters felt a bit more autobiographical than I anticipated. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, it is a book about his experiences and processes Bronson dropped the act on the latter half of the book which led to a lot of insight and notable/actionable advice. It was refreshing to see that someone who I would consider successful still deals with the same mental hurdles that I do. "It must be a self-run journey."
