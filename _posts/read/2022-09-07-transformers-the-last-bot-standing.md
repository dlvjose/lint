Transformers: The Last Bot Standing
8/10
This series had an unique take on the "end" of the Transformers. Which is poetic since it marks the end of IDW having the Transformers license. It had a few lulls but it made up for them by having more highlights. Cool to see this side of Rodimus. Seeing Rodimus exist outside of the usual cast was a breath of fresh air.
