Transformers '84: Secrets and Lies
9/10
Absolutely loved the art style and writing on these issues. If anything, I wish it was longer. This is the type of story I would love to see in an animated series. Fresh but still familiar. The use of Counterpunch as the narrator was very clever. Grimlock's depiction was definitely one of my favorites of him.
