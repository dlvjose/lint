The Bad Guys
8/10
I've been meaning to watch this movie for a while and was not disappointed. Loved the visual and animation style of it. It's not a deep movie but it never tries to be. I went into it expecting a fun, funny, and lighthearted experience and that it exceeded my expectations. Every character had it's time to shine and no one was left aside. Would 100% watch again.
