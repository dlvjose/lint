The Boy and the Heron
6/10
I wanted this movie to wow me but it fell flat on its face. Maybe I need to revisit at some point and will have a different reaction. The music and art is beautiful but the story and message felt messy. Not sure if I know what the message was to be honest. Loved Robert Pattinsons' performance as the Heron.
