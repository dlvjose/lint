Cowboy Bebop: Live Action
6/10
"Oh my sweet child... what have they done to you?" It is clear that this series was not intended for fans of the anime. It was intended for newcomers. The actors for Spike, Jet, and Faye did all they could with the script they were given. Their casting was not the issue. On the other hand Julia and Vicious were quite rough. The corny and crass humor isn't for me. The pacing of the show felt specially out of place. Seems like they had identity issues because the show wasn't it's own thing nor did it follow the anime faithfully. I can see it being enjoyable for newcomers to the series.
