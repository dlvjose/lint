Euphoria Season 2
7/10
This season was conflicting, there was some good moments. Absolutely tired of Cassie and Nate. Glad to see Lexi and Fez get a chance to shine. By far the best characters in the show. Sad to see Ashtray, the best supporting character in the show go the way he went. The Jules/Rue/Elliott love triangle was a bit much, and felt predictable. I enjoyed Eliott as a character but could've done without the love triangle.
