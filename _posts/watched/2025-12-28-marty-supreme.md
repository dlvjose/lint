Marty Supreme
8/10
While the movie felt a bit long, I can see the intention behind the included scenes. Most of the starting cast did a great performance and it felt like everyone knew what they were involved in. Tyler the Creator's performance was the most surprising thing to come out of this movie. Great movie, great cast, and great storytelling but will I rewatch it? Eh, maybe.
