Attack on Titan
8/10
Watching this anime makes me question how much of the story they had planned from the start. The pacing of this show is top-tier. The fact that the show is from the director Death Note definitely shows. The structure of the show feels very intentional and planned out. Eren is mad annoying at times and Mikasa is by far the best character.
