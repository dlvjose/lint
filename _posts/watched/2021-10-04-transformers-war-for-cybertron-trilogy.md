Transformers: War For Cybertron Trilogy
6/10
I really wanted to enjoy this show more but the voice acting was terrible. The story was great although some characters lacked depth. I'm looking at you Optimus Prime. I loved the art style but think the animation left a lot to be desired. Bittersweet to see shows like this get greenlit and finished but the good ones like Prime get canceled. Well, we'll see how Rise of the Beasts turns out. Oh, we also watched the original movie in theaters last Tuesday. That was cool, they even curse! Gasp!
