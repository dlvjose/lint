Arcane: League of Legends
9/10
Just finished the 9 episodes of season one and wow. What a spectacle. I'm unsure if I would've enjoyed it more if I was more familiar with the game. It makes me want to no-life Teamfight Tactics again. All 9 episodes were a treat. I didn't expect the show to be as heavy and mature as it was. Vi and Ekko stole the show. Very excited for season 2.
