Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness
6/10
This movie was a visual delight but left a bit to be desired on the depth/story side. They've done a great job with the evolution of the Scarlet Witch character and this movie felt more hers than Dr Strange's. There was very little character growth for him in this film. Xochitl Gomez did a great job as America Chavez. Fun watch but would've liked to see more from one of my favorite Marvel characters.
