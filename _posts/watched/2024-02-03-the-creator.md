The Creator
6/10
This movie wants to do so much but comes up short in basically all of its attempts. The gorgeous CGI carries the stale and shallow script. The actors did the best they could to get the viewer invested but fall short. The script lacked focus. Besides all that it's an enjoyable watch as a CGI spectacle.
