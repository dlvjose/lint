Good Mythical Evening
8/10
Rhett and Link did a livestream of an R rated version of GMM. It was incredibly funny, although it felt forced at some points. Like kids that just learned how to curse. Which is exactly what they said. One of the crew members involved in the rate joke bit was a bit annoying and felt like his feelings had been hurt. It was a great time regardless and I look forward to similar content in the future.
