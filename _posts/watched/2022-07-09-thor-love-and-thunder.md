Thor: Love and Thunder
6/10
Although this movie has only a single digit over the Jurassic movies there is a huge gap between those two. The movie was fun, stunning visually, amazing sonically but the story felt flat. Jane Foster was very boring for me. Definitely enjoyed Christian Bale as Gorr. Movie felt unfocused as a whole. I wonder how much the pandemic affected the production of this movie.
