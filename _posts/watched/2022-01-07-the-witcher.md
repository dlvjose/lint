The Witcher
8/10
Netflix has done a great job with this universe unlike the Cowboy Bebop one. Characters feel very fleshed out and stakes hold weight. Some parts are predictable but the always seem to have a hidden card to throw off any of your predictions. All characters feel human and unique. Motivated by their own beliefs and goals.
