Cowboy Bebop
10/10
Music still holds up. Animation is still great. I found a new appreciation for Ed this time around. Same thing for Faye. Felt like their characters connected with me more than before. Still my favorite anime. Maybe my favorite animated show. Is there even a need for a distinction? The Pierrot le Fou episode was the standout for me this time around (3rd Full Watch-through)
