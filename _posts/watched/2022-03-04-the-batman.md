The Batman
7/10
The glimmering vigilante. Very good movie that I was glad to catch in theaters. DC really needs to rty out some color correction. At times it is practically impossible to see details in scenes. Really enjoyed the portrayal of the Riddler. I wish Batman moved at a normal speed though. I recommend watching this movie in theaters.
