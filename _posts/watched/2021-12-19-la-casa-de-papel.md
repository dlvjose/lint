La Casa de Papel
8/10
This show is incredible smart and knows what it is. My main gripe is that every "part/season" feels like a re-write of the past one. I.e. Kill one or two members of the main squad per part. Rinse and repeat. I love heist shows but it is definitely repetitive. Glad I watched it but I'll probably never watch it again. Definitely one of the best shows recently though.
