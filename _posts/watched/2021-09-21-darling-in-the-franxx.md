Darling in the Franxx
9/10
From the main character designer of Gurren Lagann comes an incredible tale where teenagers and clones have to save humanity. Besides the one fan-service episode where they shuffled partners everything felt that it had intent. The ending felt a little lackluster but like enough. The action was amazing and character growth was very well paced. I will say that it is interesting that the klaxosaurs went underground to survive which is exactly what happens in Gurren Lagann with the humans. Music was great as well. Mechs are great am I right?
