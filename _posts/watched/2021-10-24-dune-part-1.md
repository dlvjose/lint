Dune: Part 1 (2021)
7/10
Definitely a movie worth seeing in theaters even though we didn't. I would say the ending fell flat and had no resolution but I know this is only part one of a planned series. If I didn't know that I would've given it a 6/10. The cast felt very fitting and stakes felt heavy. I was very confused and felt out of the loop at times. Specially during the first hour. Would definitely watch the sequel.
