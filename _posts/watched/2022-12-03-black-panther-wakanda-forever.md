Black Panther: Wakanda Forever
7/10
Very fun and touching movie but it felt a bit drawn out. I'm unsure if it was caused because of production issues which might've caused them to pivot focus but that's what it felt like. Cool to see that a lot of scenes were filmed in Puerto Rico. They did a good job honoring Chadwick Boseman.
