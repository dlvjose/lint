True Detective
8/10
So glad I gave this show a chance. The first season is an incredibly slow burn that doesn't hand-hold you through the experience yet gives you enough to string you along. The start of season two has been a bit rough but hopefully it turns around. Matthew McConaughey's and Woody Harrelson's performances in the first season are impressive. Actually, everyone in the first season is at least an interesting character
