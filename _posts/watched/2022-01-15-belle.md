Belle
7/10
The animation and visuals of this movie are breathtaking. The music was stellar. It is rare that I want to listen to a movie's soundtrack after watching. I even turned to the person next to me and said "banger" during the first song. The storytelling/message of the movie is a bit murky. If it was a bit better this movie would be up there in my top animes list. Honestly, it might already be based off the visuals and music alone.
