Transformers One
7/10
Most well rounded Transformers movie in over a decade. Sad to see that they are considering cancelling planned sequels even though they marketed it terribly. Some of the voice acting, primarily Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanson but the movie is very enjoyable. The trailers make you feel like it'll have a "Guardians of the Galaxy" vibe but what it delivers is something completely different.
